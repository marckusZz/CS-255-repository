The Driverpass project was an application designed to help teach and prepare students for a driving exam. The client was a driving instructor school, who requested a web based application for the aforementioned role of teaching and prepariong students for driving exams. I believe my diagrams were effective at communicating the way the system operates, and could be understood without previous experience in software developement. If i could revise one thing, it would be my business requirements document. I believe some requirements could've been explained clearer, and more organized overall. User needs are the most important consideration in any project- software that does not fulfill the clients purpose is worthless to the client. I made sure to make the appplication work with all browsers and OS systems to allow the client to provide service to as many customers as possible. I approach software design from a very by the books way- technical information and reading usually clears up any issue i run into. I love the use of UML diagrams and plan to use them for planning and explanation in the future.
